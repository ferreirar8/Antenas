# Antenas
 
This project involves analyzing and solving the behavior of a corner reflector antenna. The analysis utilizes the image method to simplify the problem by modeling the reflector as a series of dipoles.

The vector potential for the antenna is determined by the driven dipole and its images, leading to the formulation of Hallén’s integral equation. The project includes graphical representations of the current distribution, input impedance, and radiation patterns for different configurations and parameters. Specific tasks involve analyzing the antenna's response with varying reflector distances and dipole lengths, and comparing results with theoretical predictions.
